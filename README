File::Mosaic - assemble the constituent pieces of a file into a single file.

INSTALLATION
    
  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make
  % make test
  % make install

REQUIREMENTS

 Requires perl 5.8.0 or newer.  I have not tested it on other Perl
 versions, so it may work, but no guarantees.

 There are quite a few module requirements for such a simple library,
 but the additions of these modules makes my life easier.

 Storable
 PathTools (File::Spec)
 File::Path (ships with 5.8)
 Digest::MD5
 Log::Log4perl

PLATFORMS
 
 Tested on the following platforms:

  FreeBSD v6.1
  RedHat Enterprise Linux 4u2
